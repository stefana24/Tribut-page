                <p>Dostoyevsky is best known for his novella Notes from the Underground and for four 
                    long novels, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, The Possessed (also and more accurately 
                    known as The Demons and The Devils), and The Brothers Karamazov. Each of these works is 
                    famous for its psychological profundity, and, indeed, Dostoyevsky is commonly regarded as one of the greatest psychologists in the history of literature. He specialized in the analysis of pathological states of mind that lead to insanity, murder, and suicide and in the exploration of the emotions of humiliation, self-destruction, tyrannical domination, and murderous rage. These major works are also renowned as great “novels of ideas” that treat timeless and timely issues in philosophy and politics. Psychology and philosophy are closely linked in Dostoyevsky’s portrayals of intellectuals, who “feel ideas” in the depths of their souls. Finally, these novels broke new ground with their experiments in literary form.

                <h3>The young man</h3>
                <p>
                    Fyodor Dostoevsky, born on 11 November 1821, was the second child of Dr. Mikhail Dostoevsky and Maria Dostoevskaya . 
                    His family was very religious, and Dostoevsky was deeply religious all his life. He began reading widely when he was a youth. He was first educated by his mother, father, and tutors, but at thirteen years old he was sent to a private school. 
                    When Dostoevsky was eighteen, he was attending school in St. Petersburg, Russia. Dostoevsky was trained to be a military engineer, but he disliked the millitary school and loved literature. When he finished school, he turned from the career he was trained for and devoted himself to writing.

                <h3>Early writings</h3>
                <p>
                    Dostoevsky began his career writing fiction about poor people in harsh situations. In 1843 he finished his first novel, Poor Folk, a social tale about a down-and-out government worker. The novel was praised by a respected critic.

                <h3>Siberian Exile</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1847 he joined a antigovernment group called the Petrashevsky Circle. In 1849 the members were arrested. After eight months in prison, Dostoevsky was "sentenced" to death (the sentence was changed in the last minutes). At one point, however, Dostoevsky believed he had only few moments left to live, and he never forgot the feelings of that experience. He was sentenced to four years in prison and four years of forced service in the army in Siberia, Russia.

                <h3>Notes from the Underground </h3>
                <p>
                    After Dostoevsky returned to St. Petersburg in 1859, he started to work on Notes from the Underground which is a short novel. In this work Dostoevsky attempts to justify the existence of individual freedom as a necessary part of humankind. He argues against the view that man is a creature of reason and that society can be organized in a way that guarantees the happiness of humans. He insists that humans desire freedom more than happiness, but he also sees that unchecked freedom is a destructive force.

                <h3>The great novels</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1866 Dostoevsky published Crime and Punishment, which is the most popular of his great novels, perhaps because it is appealing on different levels. It can be read as a serious and complex work of art, but it can also be enjoyed as a gripping detective story.
                    The Dostoevskys traveled in 1867 and remained away from Russia for more than four years. Their economic condition was very difficult, and Dostoevsky repeatedly lost what little money they had while gambling. The Idiot was written between 1867 and 1869, and Dostoevsky stated that in this work he intended to portray "the wholly beautiful man."
                    Dostoevsky began writing The Possessed (also translated as The Devils ) in 1870 and published it in 1871–1872.
                    The Brothers Karamazov (1879–1880) is the greatest of Dostoevsky's novels. The psychologist Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) ranked it as one of the greatest artistic achievements of all time.
